## Chapter 2:
<details>
<summary>What is the 80 20 principle?</summary>
The 80 20 principle refers to the idea that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes or inputs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is the discoverer of the Pareto principle?</summary>
Vilfredo Pareto is the discoverer of the Pareto principle.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some examples of the 80 20 principle in various fields?</summary>
Examples of the 80 20 principle include the majority of income being earned by the minority of people, the majority of book sales coming from a small percentage of authors, and the majority of results in various fields being generated by a small percentage of efforts.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can the Pareto principle be applied in programming?</summary>
In programming, the 80 20 principle suggests focusing on the vital few tasks or features that will have the most impact, rather than trying to do everything. This can lead to more efficient and effective coding.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some practical tips for leveraging the Pareto principle?</summary>
Practical tips for leveraging the Pareto principle include identifying your success metrics, setting big goals, finding ways to achieve the same results with fewer resources, reflecting on past successes and failures, reading more books in your field, focusing on improving existing products rather than creating new ones, maintaining a positive attitude, and avoiding activities that reduce value.
</details>

### Chapter 2 Summary
*The 80/20 principle, also known as the Pareto principle, states that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. By focusing on the vital few important tasks and ignoring the trivial many, you can achieve more results as a professional coder.*



## Chapter 3:
<details>
<summary>What is the main idea behind building a minimum viable product (MVP)?</summary>
The main idea behind building an MVP is to create a stripped-down version of a product that includes only the most necessary features, in order to quickly test and validate hypotheses without wasting time on unnecessary development.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of using a minimum viable product (MVP) approach?</summary>
Some advantages of using an MVP approach include cost-effectiveness in testing hypotheses, minimizing time spent on coding and bug fixing, receiving instant user feedback, reducing future maintenance costs, making faster progress, and building a brand more predictably.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the pitfalls of developing software without using MVPs?</summary>
Pitfalls of developing software without using MVPs include loss of motivation, distractions, running over time, lack of response from users, wrong assumptions about the target audience, and unnecessary complexity in the codebase.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can an MVP help combat distractions and loss of motivation?</summary>
An MVP can combat distractions and loss of motivation by reducing the time from idea to market response, allowing for more immediate feedback, and helping refocus attention on the core functionality of the product.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the concept of split testing fit into the MVP approach?</summary>
Split testing is a technique used in the MVP approach where two product variants are tested simultaneously, and user response is observed to determine which variant performs better based on key user metrics. This helps in making data-driven decisions about which features to keep or discard in subsequent iterations.
</details>

### Chapter 3 Summary
*Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to quickly test and validate hypotheses without wasting time on unnecessary features. The MVP approach allows for cost-effectiveness, reduced coding time, faster progress, and faster product launch.*

<summary>What is one of the strategies for performance tuning?</summary>
One strategy for performance tuning is to measure the performance of your non-optimized code before making improvements.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of caching?</summary>
Caching allows you to store the results of previous computations, reducing the need for redundant calculations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should you stop optimizing for performance?</summary>
You should stop optimizing when you reach the maximum runtime that is acceptable for your application and when further optimization would not provide significant value.

<details>
<summary>What are the 15 principles of the Unix philosophy?</summary>
The 15 principles of the Unix philosophy are:

Make each function do one thing well
Simple is better than complex
Small is beautiful
Build a prototype as soon as possible
Choose portability over efficiency
Store data in flat text files
Use software leverage to your advantage
Avoid captive user interfaces
Make every program a filter
Worse is better
Clean code is better than clever code
Design programs to be connected with other programs
Make your code robust
Repair what you can but fail early and noisily
Write programs to write programs
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why is it important to make each function do one thing well?</summary>
Making each function do one thing well improves code readability, reduces bugs, and allows for better code reuse.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can you ensure code robustness?</summary>
Code robustness can be ensured by using versioning systems like Git, regularly backing up application data, and using distributed systems to avoid a single point of failure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the principle of worse is better?</summary>
The principle of worse is better suggests that it is often better to release a less perfect product quickly than to strive for perfection before releasing it. This allows for a first mover advantage and early feedback.
