<summary>What are some features that make Python modules great?</summary>
- Python modules make Python extensible and allow for the building of applications quickly and simply by combining extensions.
- They are essential for Python to flourish within a giant ecosystem.
- They allow for modular programming and code reusability.
- They provide access to variables and functions related to Python itself and the operating system it is running on.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the import system work in Python?</summary>
- Modules and libraries can be imported in Python using the import keyword.
- The import function is a wrapper around a function named import.
- The import function is useful for importing modules whose names are unknown beforehand.
- The import system relies on a list of paths, stored in the sys.path variable, to know where to look for modules.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the sys module and its functions used for in Python?</summary>
- The sys module provides access to variables and functions related to Python itself and the operating system it is running on.
- It allows for retrieving the list of currently imported modules using the sys.modules variable.
- It allows for retrieving the list of built-in modules using the sys.builtin_module_names variable.
- It provides the sys.path variable, which contains the list of paths used for module importation.
- It allows for changing or adding import paths using the sys.path.append() function.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can custom importers be used in Python?</summary>
- Custom importers can be used to extend the import system and modify how Python imports modules.
- There are two ways to extend the import system: meta path finders for use with the sys.meta_path variable, and path entry finders for use with sys.path_hooks.
- A meta path finder is an object that allows for loading custom objects as well as standard .py files.
- A meta path finder must expose a find_module(fullname, path=None) method that returns a loader object, and the loader object must have a load_module(fullname) method responsible for loading the module from a source file.

## Chapter 7:
<details>
<summary>What are decorators in Python and how do they work behind the scenes?</summary>
Decorators are functions that modify other functions by taking them as arguments and replacing them with new functions. They work behind the scenes by adding functionality to the original functions without modifying their code directly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you create a decorator in Python?</summary>
To create a decorator, you define a function with the decorator syntax (@decorator_name) placed directly above the function you want to decorate. The decorator function takes another function as an argument, usually named 'f', and returns a new modified function that incorporates the desired functionality.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can decorators be used to modify function behavior?</summary>
Decorators can be used to add functionality such as logging, timing, or authentication to a function without modifying its code directly. By applying a decorator to a function, the decorator function wraps the original function and adds the desired behavior before, after, or around the original function's execution.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are static methods and class methods in Python?</summary>
Static methods are functions that belong to a class but do not operate on or affect class instances. They are used to create utility functions that do not depend on the state of the class or its objects. Class methods are bound to a class rather than its instances. They operate on the parameters they take and can access the state and methods of the class but not the state of individual objects.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of abstract methods and abstract base classes in Python?</summary>
Abstract methods are defined in abstract base classes and do not provide any implementation. They must be overridden by subclasses that inherit from the abstract base class. Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces and ensure that classes derived from the base class implement particular methods. They cannot be instantiated directly and must be used as parent classes.
</details>

### Chapter 7 Summary
*Covers decorators, static, class, and abstract methods, super() function, creating decorators, and method types.*


## Chapter 8:
<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a generator in Python and how does it work?</summary>
A generator is an object that behaves like an iterator. It generates and returns a value on each call of its next() method until a StopIteration is raised. Generators are created by writing a regular Python function that contains a yield statement. When execution reaches the yield statement, the function returns a value but saves a stack reference to resume its execution when the next() function is called again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can you create a list comprehension in Python?</summary>
A list comprehension in Python is created by writing a regular Python expression inside square brackets, and optionally including one or more for loops and if statements to generate and filter the items in the list.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some useful functions in the itertools module of the Python Standard Library?</summary>
Some useful functions in the itertools module of the Python Standard Library include accumulate, chain, combinations, compress, count, cycle, repeat, dropwhile, groupby, permutations, product, and takewhile. These functions can help manipulate and iterate over data in various ways.

## Chapter 11:
<details>
<summary>What are some paradigms that don't apply correctly to Python when it comes to scalability?</summary>
Some paradigms that don't apply correctly to Python in terms of scalability are multithreading and its limitations, particularly in relation to the Python global interpreter lock (GIL).
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does multithreading work in Python and what is its primary mechanism for introducing concurrency?</summary>
Multithreading in Python allows code to run concurrently inside a single Python process by running several threads simultaneously. It uses the primary mechanism of introducing concurrency in Python, especially when the computer has multiple processors, by running threads in parallel across multiple processors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is the Python global interpreter lock (GIL) a limitation in scaling applications with multiple threads?</summary>
The Python global interpreter lock (GIL) is a lock that prevents multiple threads from having control of the Python interpreter at the same time. This limitation means that if an application tries to run multiple threads to scale its workload, it will always be limited by this global lock, resulting in limited CPU usage.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does multiprocessing in Python compare to multithreading in terms of scalability and CPU usage?</summary>
Multiprocessing in Python is a preferred solution for scaling applications with CPU-intensive workloads, as it allows for spreading the workload across several CPU cores. It offers better scalability and can utilize more CPU power compared to multithreading, which is limited by the global interpreter lock.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is asyncio and how does it provide support for event-driven programming in Python?</summary>
Asyncio is a module in Python that provides a framework for writing asynchronous code and leveraging event loops. It supports various protocols and allows for event-driven programming, where a program can be kept busy doing other tasks while waiting for inputs and outputs to complete. It simplifies the development of asynchronous applications and has become the de facto standard in Python for event-driven programming.
