<summary>3. Name three data types mentioned in the text.</summary>
Integer, floating point number, string
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. What is an expression and what do all expressions do?</summary>
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value. All expressions evaluate down to a single value.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</summary>

"spam" * 3 should evaluate to "spamspamspam"
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Why is "eggs" a valid variable name while "100" is invalid?</summary>
Variable names cannot start with a number, but they can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Therefore, "eggs" is a valid variable name, but "100" is not.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating point number, or string version of a value?</summary>
int(), float(), str()

## Chapter 3:

<details>
<summary>1. What are the advantages of having functions in your programs?</summary>
Functions help in organizing your code and making it more modular.
They allow you to reuse the same code in different parts of your program.
They make the code more readable and easier to understand.
They help in debugging and isolating errors in your code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?</summary>
The code in a function executes when the function is called.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What statement creates a function?</summary>
The def statement is used to create a function in Python.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?</summary>
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can take input parameters and return output values.
A function call is when you use the function name followed by parentheses to execute the code within the function.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?</summary>
There is only one global scope in a Python program.
The number of local scopes depends on the number of function calls made within the program. Each function call creates its own local scope.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?</summary>
Variables in a local scope are destroyed and their values are forgotten when the function call returns.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?</summary>
A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to and returns to the caller.
Yes, a return value can be part of an expression and can be used like any other value in an expression.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?</summary>
If a function does not have a return statement, the return value of a call to that function is None.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?</summary>
You can use the global keyword before the variable name within the function to indicate that the variable is referring to the global variable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. What is the data type of None?</summary>
The data type of None is NoneType.
</details>

<details>
<summary>11. What does the "import areallyourpetsnamederic" statement do?</summary>
The statement "import areallyourpetsnamederic" imports a module named "areallyourpetsnamederic" into your program. It allows you to use the functions and variables defined in that module.
</details>

<details>
<summary>12. If you had a function named bacon in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?</summary>
You can call the function bacon from the module spam by using the syntax spam.bacon().
</details>

<details>
<summary>13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?</summary>
You can use try and except statements to catch and handle errors in a program. The code that could potentially cause an error is put in a try block, and the code to handle the error is put in an except block.
</details>

<details>
<summary>14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?</summary>
The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.
The code to handle the error goes in the except clause.
</details>
