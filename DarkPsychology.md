### Chapter 2 Summary
*Mind control and brainwashing do exist and they work, although not as exaggerated as portrayed in TV shows and movies. People can be brainwashed through various means such as advertisements, social media, and news reports. Brainwashing is a severe form of social influence that aims to control thoughts and actions without consent. Brainwashing techniques include compliance, persuasion, and education methods. Brainwashing requires total control over the victim, including their eating and sleeping habits. The process of brainwashing involves breaking down the victim's identity and replacing it with new beliefs and behaviors. Victims can potentially regain their old beliefs and attitudes if their new identity stops being reinforced. The media, including social media, plays a significant role in influencing and persuading people through advertisements and personalized content. Researchers have studied the effectiveness of social media advertising campaigns based on users' psychological traits. Psychological assessment of digital footprints can be used for both positive and negative purposes, including persuasion and mental control.*

</details>

### Chapter 3 Summary
*Neuro linguistic programming (NLP) is a form of therapy that aims to help individuals achieve their specific goals by focusing on the interplay of neurology, language, and programming. NLP focuses on three behavioral patterns: physical, cognitive, and linguistic behaviors. It offers techniques to replace negative thought and behavioral patterns with positive ones. Using positive language can modify behavior by influencing the subconscious mind. NLP can help you move towards what you want rather than away from what you don't want. NLP techniques can also be applied to processing information based on visual, kinesthetic, or auditory functions, allowing for more efficient communication with others. Effective communication with visual individuals requires using visual cues and gestures, while auditory individuals prefer linear presentations and modulated tones. Kinesthetic individuals trust their gut feelings and respond well to creative presentations. To make your statements memorable, use the word 'but' to emphasize the second half of your sentence and use the word 'and' to ensure people remember your entire sentence. NLP can help you discover unseen opportunities and achieve success by changing the way you talk. Mastering these techniques can lead to getting what you want in life.*

</details>

### Chapter 5 Summary
*Subliminal messages are often embedded in other media and are meant to be picked up subconsciously by the brain. Subliminal advertising refers to the use of hidden images or words that people cannot consciously detect. Subliminal stimuli are usually presented briefly and go undetected by people. Subliminal advertising injects signals that cannot be detected by the naked eye but can be detected by the subconscious mind, influencing a person's subsequent actions and thoughts. Techniques such as shadows, light, and visual effects are used to affect the perception of dimensions and create illusions. People can be influenced outside of their awareness, like responding to subliminally presented words associated with hunger by eating more. People may become unaware of the related words and influences on their actions. Stimuli that people become aware of can also exert influences on behaviors that they are not aware of, like buying more Italian wine when hearing Italian songs in liquor stores. Backmasking is a technique where sounds are recorded backward, which may be unintelligible to conscious hearing but understandable to the subconscious mind and can influence actions. Subliminal messages can affect a person's state of mind and behaviors, so it is important to be alert when watching or listening to advertisements. Subliminal messages can also be seen in movies and television shows for various purposes like introducing characters, advertising upcoming episodes, or promoting political candidates.
