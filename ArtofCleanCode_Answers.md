### file_10_answer.txt:

**Three Answers:**
1. The 80 20 Principle is the idea that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. To apply it in research, one should focus on success metrics such as number of citations, high quality papers, and words written per day. By spending more time on these actionable lead measures, productivity and success can be increased.
2. The Pareto distribution demonstrates that small improvements in productivity can result in disproportional increases in output and rewards. Therefore, it is important to focus on the vital few areas that can yield the greatest productivity gains rather than spreading attention thinly across many areas.
3. The software industry exhibits extreme Pareto distributions due to factors such as the ability for a great programmer to solve problems that others cannot, write faster and more efficient code, and write code with fewer bugs that are easier to extend. Becoming a great programmer requires understanding various technologies, being communicative and creative, staying educated, and more.

### file_13_answer.txt:

Answers:
1. The Pareto principle suggests that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This principle can be applied to software development by focusing on the vital few features of a product and improving them rather than constantly creating new products without optimizing the old ones.
2. Reading books in your field can help you simulate practical experience without investing as much time and energy, learn from others' mistakes, acquire new skills, and become a highly educated expert in your field. It is considered a success metric that can help catapult you to success.
3. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product stripped of all except the most necessary features in order to test and validate hypotheses quickly without losing a lot of time in implementing features that users may not end up using. It is important in software development because it helps to reduce complexity and accelerate progress by focusing on features that are confirmed by users and known to be wanted.

1. The main problem with following the stealth mode of programming is that it often leads to loss of motivation, distractions, takes longer than anticipated, and most importantly, no product-market fit.
2. Common pitfalls of working in stealth mode include loss of motivation, distractions, running over time, lack of response, wrong assumptions, and unnecessary complexity.
3. An MVP can combat the problems of distraction and running over time by reducing the time from idea to market response, creating an environment of immediate feedback that helps refocus your attention. The MVP approach also helps develop the project to directly address the most pressing customer needs, increasing the chances of customer engagement and response to early product versions.


### file_15_answer.txt:
# 3. What is the solution to avoid unnecessary complexity in software development?

# Answers:
# 1. Releasing all features at once makes it difficult to know which subset of features the market would prefer or accept. 
# 2. Maintaining unnecessary features can increase implementation costs, introduce new bugs, make the codebase more complicated, and increase learning time for new coders joining the project.

### file_16_answer.txt:
3. What are the four pillars of building a Minimum Viable Product?

**Three answers:**

1. The two phases discussed in Figure 3 are finding product-market fit through iterative MVP creation and building interest over time, and scaling up by adding and validating new features through carefully designed split tests.

### file_17_answer.txt:

Answers: 


1. The common counterargument against rapid prototyping is that stealth programming protects your ideas. People assume their idea is special and unique enough that if they release it in the raw form as an MVP, it will get stolen by larger and more powerful companies that can implement it more quickly.

### file_23_answer.txt:

Three Answers:
1. Small code is code that accomplishes a single specified task with a relatively small number of lines of code. It is important because it is easier to read, understand, and maintain, compared to large monolithic code blocks.
2. The Law of Demeter is a principle of object-oriented programming that advocates minimizing the interdependency of code elements. By reducing dependencies between code objects, you reduce the complexity of your code and improve maintainability. This is achieved by ensuring each object only calls its own methods or methods from adjacent objects, rather than calling methods of objects obtained from calling a method of an adjacent object.
3. An example of violating the Law of Demeter is when an object A calls a method provided by object B, which returns a reference to object C. Object A then performs a method of object B followed by another method of object C. This is called chaining of method calls and violates the Law of Demeter since object A is talking to a friend of a friend, rather than its immediate friends.
### file_24_answer.txt:

Answers:
1. The method "per cup" calculates the depreciation per cup and uses it to estimate the price of a single cup.
2. The Law of Demeter is a design principle that suggests minimizing dependencies between classes by limiting communication between objects. In the given code, adhering to the Law of Demeter was achieved by having the Person class talk only to the Coffee Cup class.
3. Principle 14 suggests that code should only be implemented when it is absolutely necessary. Adding unnecessary code can needlessly complicate the codebase, making maintenance and updates more difficult. This approach to code development can offset the trend towards growing complexity with a large number of objects/dependencies.
### file_25_answer.txt:
3. How can code quality metrics be used to track complexity over time?

Answers:

2. The MVP principle involves building a minimum viable product to avoid getting stuck in the cycle of perfectionism.
3. The cost of specializing a data format for a specific purpose is reduced portability and the sacrifice of efficiency.
### file_36_answer.txt:

Answers:
1. Optimized data representations allow programs to read from data with less memory consumption and less overhead than general flat text files. They are used to increase efficiency in reading and accessing data.
2. Optimized data representations should be used only if you are sure you need them, such as in highly performance sensitive applications. For smaller applications, such as training a machine learning model from a real world dataset with 10,000 entries, the CSV format is the recommended way to store data.
3. Leverage in programming means using collective wisdom of generations of coders before you, using libraries for complex functionality rather than coding it from scratch, and employing computing power. Good coders create good source code quickly, but great coders tap into the many sources of leverage to elevate their code.

### file_8_answer.txt:

### Answers
1. The purpose of the book "Deep Work" by Cal Newport is to provide rules for focused success in a distracted world and to increase the productivity of programming efforts.
2. The 80 20 principle refers to the idea that a majority of effects (80 percent) come from a minority of causes (20 percent). By focusing efforts on the important things that make up the 20 percent of activities that lead to 80 percent of the results, professionals can achieve many more results and ignore the many things that hardly move the needle.
3. An example of the Pareto distribution in action is an imaginary software project where the minority of the code is responsible for the majority of the runtime. The vital few code functions contribute to most of the overall runtime, while the trivial many contribute very little even if optimized.
### file_9_answer.txt:

### Answers
1. Scientific evidence for the existence of Pareto distributions in software projects is provided by "Power Laws in Software" by Louridas Spinellis and Vlachos in 2008.
2. Only 20% of code functions have a dominating impact on the user experience, while the rest of the code has little impact. The large companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Apple use the Pareto principle to optimize the 20% of code functions that are executed most often by the average user.
3. Success metrics are measurements of the behaviors that lead to more success in a particular field. The most important success metric can differ from field to field. In the case of researchers, writing high-quality papers is the most important activity for generating a maximal number of citations and improving performance.
