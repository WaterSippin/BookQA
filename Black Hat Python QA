Questions: 
1. What is the trojan framework designed to do?
2. How does the trojan framework use GitHub?
3. How are the modules and configuration files stored in the GitHub repository?
4. How does the trojan retrieve and run modules from the GitHub repository?
5. What method does the trojan use to communicate with the GitHub repository?

Answers:
1. The trojan framework is designed to perform tasks on compromised machines and report the findings back to the attacker.
2. The trojan framework uses GitHub to store configuration information, exfiltrate data from victim systems, and host modules needed for executing tasks.
3. The modules are stored in the "modules" directory and the configuration files are stored in the "config" directory of the GitHub repository.
4. The trojan retrieves the configuration file from the repository, imports modules by hacking Python's import functionality to fetch remote files from the repository, and then runs the modules.
5. The trojan uses the GitHub API to connect to the repository and retrieve files and data through HTTPS.

Questions:

1. What are some common ways to escalate privileges in a Windows network?
2. Why is it important to have multiple ways to achieve privileged access?
3. How can Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) be used to monitor process creation?
4. How can file monitoring be used to find privilege escalation vulnerabilities?
5. What is code injection and how can it be used for privilege escalation? 

Answers:

1. Exploiting poorly coded drivers or native Windows kernel issues, taking advantage of high privilege processes, using automation tasks or scripts executed by system administrators or vendors.

2. Multiple ways of achieving privileged access are important in case a patch cycle causes access to be lost or to have options for different enterprise environments with difficult-to-analyze software.

3. WMI can be used to monitor the creation of new processes by setting up a flexible interface that tracks file paths, user creation, and enabled privileges.

4. File monitoring can help identify processes that handle files or execute binaries that are writable by low privilege users, allowing for potential privilege escalation.

5. Code injection is the act of injecting code into an existing process. This can be used for privilege escalation by injecting code into files executed by high privilege processes, allowing for the execution of commands with elevated privileges.
